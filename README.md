# Private Events

This project builds a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and manager user signups. This is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events).

Key Features:
- Show a list of all events, sorted into future and past events
- Allow registered and logged in users to sign up or remove themselves from events
- Show all of the events that a user is hosting or attending
- Allow specific users to be invited to the event when it is created
- Edit events, including who is invited

A live demo of the site is on [Heroku](https://ancient-lowlands-33809.herokuapp.com/). If you wish to try the features without creating a new user you can use the following:
- email: user@example.com
- password: password
